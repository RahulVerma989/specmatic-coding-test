# Products API

Welcome to the Products API, an asynchronous FastAPI application that manages a catalog of products, allowing for operations such as listing, creating, updating, and deleting products.

## Features

- **List Products**: Retrieve all products or filter them by type.
- **Create Product**: Add a new product to the inventory.
- **Update Product**: Modify details of an existing product.
- **Delete Product**: Remove a product from the inventory.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (for running the API server)

### Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RahulVerma989/specmatic-coding-test.git
cd specmatic-coding-test
```

### Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To run the API server, use the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload 8080
```

This will start the server on http://localhost:8080. The --reload flag enables auto-reloading of the server when code changes are made.

## Usage

### Accessing the API

Once the server is running, you can access the following endpoints:

- GET /products: List all products or filter by type.
- POST /products: Create a new product by sending JSON payload.
- PUT /products/{product_id}: Update a product by providing the product ID and JSON payload.
- DELETE /products/{product_id}: Delete a product by providing the product ID.

#### Example Requests

You can use curl or any HTTP client to interact with the API. Here is an example of listing products:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/products" -H "accept: application/json"
```
